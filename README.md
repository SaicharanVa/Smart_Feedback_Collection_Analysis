🚀 Smart Feedback Collection and Sentiment Analysis Platform
Feedback Analysis is a Flask-based full-stack web application that allows users to submit feedback, automatically analyzes sentiment using VADER and TextBlob NLP models, and provides administrators with a secure visual dashboard for insights and reporting.

This project demonstrates end-to-end development — combining Flask (Python), NLP (VADER + TextBlob), data visualization (Chart.js), and secure authentication — to deliver a real-world feedback management solution.

🌟 Key Features
👥 User Features
Authentication & Access Control: Secure registration and login with Flask-Login and password hashing via Werkzeug

Intelligent Feedback Submission: Users (authenticated or anonymous) can submit textual feedback, rating (1-5), and optionally upload images

Real-Time Sentiment Analysis: On submission, VADER and TextBlob models process feedback text and store sentiment categories and scores

Feedback History: Logged-in users can view their previously submitted feedback

🧠 Admin Features
Admin Dashboard: Interactive charts using Chart.js for sentiment distribution, rating trends, and feedback volume

Advanced Analytics: View aggregated statistics, search/filter feedback, and export reports

Reporting Tools: CSV and PDF report exports with date-based and sentiment-based filtering

Secure File Handling: Uploaded images validated with Pillow (PIL) and stored with sanitized filenames

⚙️ Setup and Installation
🧱 Prerequisites
Ensure you have:

Python 3.x

pip (Python package manager)

Virtual environment (recommended)

🔧 Installation Steps
bash
# Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/SaicharanVa/FeedbackHub.git
cd FeedbackHub

# Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Linux/Mac
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
🗄️ Initialize Database & Folders
bash
# Create uploads directory
mkdir uploads

# The database (feedback.db) and tables are created automatically on first run
▶️ Run the Application
bash
python app.py
Then open: 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000

✅ Data Export (CSV, PDF)

✅ Input and File Validation

📈 Architecture & Workflow Overview
Workflow Steps
User Registration/Login → Credentials verified & stored securely

Feedback Submission → Data + optional image sent to backend

Sentiment Analysis → Processed using VADER + TextBlob NLP

Database Storage → Results stored in SQLite database

Admin Dashboard → Data visualized using Chart.js

Report Generation → Export as CSV or PDF

🏗️ System Architecture











💡 Next Steps & Future Ideas
Alembic Integration: Replace manual migrations with database migration support

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Add granular permissions for staff/admin roles

Rate Limiting: Use Flask-Limiter to prevent spam submissions

Pagination & Filtering: Optimize admin table performance for large datasets

AI-based NLP Models: Upgrade with advanced models (BERT, DistilBERT)

Cloud Deployment: Host on AWS, Azure, or Render for scalability
